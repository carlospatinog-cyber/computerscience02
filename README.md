# Computer Science II


## ðŸ“– Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for a project developed as part of the **Computer Science II (2570201)** course. Its primary purpose is to apply the fundamental concepts of the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm using C++. The project serves as a practical application for building software solutions aimed at solving problems and challenges faced by engineers in a professional context.

Aligned with the course goals, this project simulates an industry-like environment, utilizing key tools and practices such as version control with Git/Bitbucket, modern C++ compilers, and collaborative development techniques to implement robust software designs, algorithms, and data structures.
