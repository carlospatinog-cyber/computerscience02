# Computer Science II


## ðŸ“– Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for a project developed as part of the **Computer Science II (2570201)** course. Its primary purpose is to apply the fundamental concepts of the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm using C++. The project serves as a practical application for building software solutions aimed at solving problems and challenges faced by engineers in a professional context.

Aligned with the course goals, this project simulates an industry-like environment, utilizing key tools and practices such as version control with Git/Bitbucket, modern C++ compilers, and collaborative development techniques to implement robust software designs, algorithms, and data structures.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop a foundational and practical understanding of the C++ programming language. Through its development, 
I aim to:
  - Master Core Syntax and Structure: Solidify my knowledge of fundamental C++ elements, including data types, variables, operators, control flow (loops and conditionals), functions, and basic input/output operations.
  - Understand Memory Management: Gain initial experience with crucial C++ concepts like pointers, references, and the differences between stack and dynamic memory allocation.
  - Apply Object-Oriented Principles: Implement the core pillars of OOPâ€”Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphismâ€”to create well-structured and modular code that effectively models real-world entities and relationships.
  - Develop Problem-Solving Skills: Translate problem statements and requirements into efficient and logical C++ code, strengthening my algorithmic thinking.
  - Establish a Development Workflow: Integrate the use of a compiler, version control with Git/Bitbucket, and a structured project organization into my standard workflow for software development.
  - 
This project serves as a practical milestone in building the essential skills required to tackle more complex software engineering challenges using C++.
